# Introduction

This repository was created to publish the code for the analysis in [1]. It is meant to make reproducibility easier of the results in that work and a starting point for further chronological network analysis.

*Disclaimer: As the main goal of this code publication is the reproduction of the results in [1], the code is not well-documented. If you wish to use this work as a basis for your own work or have some questions, please contact the authors (frank.moshe@inpe.br, leonardo.ferreira@inpe.br, davo@icmc.usp.br) .*


## Data

As detailed in [1] this project uses the ** last version (C6) of MODIS ** from the Aqua and Terra satellites, operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The time interval is between 01 January 2003 and 31 January 2018 and the region under study is a portion of the Amazon basin, that is located between longitude 70W, 50W and latitude 15S, 5N. 

The [Chronets_7days-2003-01-to-2018-02.zip](Chronets_7days-2003-01-to-2018-02.zip) file contains the set of temporal ** Chronets ** (chronological networks), of the 15 years of data divide by time frames of 7 days.
